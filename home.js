Frameworks such as React.js, Vue.js, Spring and SpringBoot were the most commonly used. I have worked in groups and on my own, as well as with professionals during two longer internships. ',
    'I am currently looking for a workplace where my programming skills can be of use. Do you know of a good fit and want to get in touch? Contact me by email or via my LinkedIn. Both are linked in the navigation bar'
